# Limited Activity and Response Program (LARP)

LARP is a lightweight program designed to facilitate controlled activity and response interactions. Itâ€™s useful for scenarios where minimal or constrained responses are necessary, such as testing environments or automated systems with limited functionality.

---

## Features

- **Configurable Activity Levels**: Set specific levels of activity to simulate different scenarios.
- **Response Management**: Define and handle limited responses based on predefined conditions.
- **Lightweight Design**: Minimal setup and dependencies for ease of integration.

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LARP.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd LARP
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

---

## Usage

1. Configure the settings file (`config.json`) to define activity levels and response parameters.
2. Run the program:
    ```bash
    python larp.py
    ```
3. Monitor outputs in the console or log files as per your configuration.

## Configuration

The `config.json` file allows you to define:

- **Activity Levels**: Specify the intensity and scope of activities.
- **Response Rules**: Define triggers and corresponding actions for responses.
- **Logging Options**: Control logging verbosity and output destinations.

Example `config.json`:
```json
{
  "activity_level": "low",
  "response_rules": [
    {"trigger": "event_a", "response": "action_1"},
    {"trigger": "event_b", "response": "action_2"}
  ],
  "logging": {
    "level": "info",
    "file": "logs/larp.log"
  }
}
```
